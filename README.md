# m11n Gravel Tiles

This project is based on the CyclOSM map style. The original config was stripped down to the
required minimum for rendering the gravel overlay. All documention etc. was kept — read below
for more info on CyclOSM.

The gravel layer is visible in zoom levels 11 and up. To get an idea on how it looks,
take a look on the following screenshot or try it out on **[https://brouter.m11n.de/](https://brouter.m11n.de/#map=11/52.5014/13.3741/standard,m11n%20Gravel%20%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F&profile=m11n-gravel-pre)**.

brouter.m11n.de renders the gravel tiles for Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

## Map Keys

- pink line with white outline: perfectly suitable for gravel riding
- dashed pink line: suitable for gravel riding, more demanding surface (rougher, softer etc.)
- dashed black-pink lines: sandy surface, avoid these ways
- dashed black-yellow lines: sett/cobblesone, avoid these ways

CyclOSM
=======

CyclOSM is a [CartoCSS](https://carto.com/developers/styling/cartocss/) map style
designed with cycling in mind. It leverages
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data to create a beautiful and
practical cycling map!

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style)

[![CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org/images/social_media.png)](https://www.cyclosm.org/)


## Demonstration

A demonstration of this style is available at [https://cyclosm.org](https://cyclosm.org).

The tile server url is
`https://{s}.tile-cyclosm.openstreetmap.fr/cyclosm/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. Tiles can
be reused under the general OpenStreetMap [tile usage
policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/).

The map is available by default in the following smartphone applications:
- [OSMAnd](https://osmand.net/)
- [OpenMultiMaps](https://framagit.org/tom79/openmaps)
- [All-In-One Offline Maps](https://www.offline-maps.net) and [AlpineQuest Rando GPS](https://alpinequest.net)

The tile server is provided by
[OpenStreetMap-France](https://www.openstreetmap.fr), many thanks to them for
the support!

## Philosophy

CyclOSM is a new cycle-oriented render. Contrary to
[OpenCycleMap](http://opencyclemap.org/), this render is free and open-source
software and aims at being more complete to take into account a wider
diversity of cycling habits.

In urban areas, it renders the main different types of cycle tracks and lanes,
on each side of the road, for helping you draw your bike to work route. It also
features essential POIs as well as bicycle parking spots or spots shared with
motorbikes, specific infrastructure (elevators / ramps), road speeds or
surfaces to avoid streets with pavings, bumpers and bike boxes, etc.

The same render also lets you visualize main bicycle touring routes as well as
essential POIs when touring (emergency services, shelters, tourism, shops).


## Features

Render:

* Cycleways track, lanes, cycle-bus lanes
* Motor oneway - two way for bicycle
* Cycle routes (local, regional, national, international)
* Parking for bicycle (or motorcycle parking open to bicycle)
* Steps with bicycle friendly ramp
* Bicycle shop and repair stations
* First aid amenities : shelter, hospital, pharmacy, police station, water, food store
* Travel amenities : camping, hotel, train station, museum, picnic table, peaks...
* Emphasis on low speed roads (<= 30km/h)
* Elevation curves and shading
* Smoothness of the roads
* Traffic calming
* …
